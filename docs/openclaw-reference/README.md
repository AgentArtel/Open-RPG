# OpenClaw reference (not included in clone)

The full OpenClaw source is not tracked in this repo to keep clone size small.

To add the reference locally, clone the upstream repo into this folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git .
```

Then you can browse the source and docs here for pattern extraction (see AGENTS.md: we extract patterns only, not import OpenClaw as a dependency).
