# RPGJS reference (not included in clone)

The full RPGJS v4 source and docs are not tracked in this repo to keep clone size small.

To add the reference locally, clone the upstream repo into this folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RSamaium/RPG-JS.git .
```

Then you can browse the source and docs here (see AGENTS.md and `docs/rpgjs-guide.md`).
